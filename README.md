# Palindrome Checker

This project is a Java program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter casing. The program uses a stack and a queue to perform the palindrome check, comparing characters in reverse and original order.

## Features

- **Input Flexibility**: Users can input any string, and the program will determine if it is a palindrome.
- **Stack and Queue**: The program uses the Java `Stack` and `Queue` classes to compare the characters.
- **Continuous Operation**: The program runs in a loop until the user inputs `'q'` to quit.
- **Case-Insensitive**: The palindrome check ignores letter case.
- **Ignores Punctuation and Spaces**: The program removes spaces and punctuation before performing the check.
